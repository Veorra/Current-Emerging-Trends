# Current-Emerging-Trends

1) Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For this project I was given instructions to create a pirate intelligent agent that would be used in a treasure hunt game in order to locate said treasure and learn from its mistakes in order to find the most optimal path to said treasure. I was given starter code and needed to create and implement a deep Q-learning algorithm to train the agent. The learning algorithm was created by me and used to locate the treasure in the most optimal manner. 

2) Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
a) What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer Scientists help bridge machines and people together in order to implement  code into everyday problems. In addition the ability to look through mathematical problems and bring them to life through code creation is incredibly powerful.
b) How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?


As a computer scientist, I approach problems in a divide and conquer type of manner. When presented with a problem I do my best to break it down into more manageable pieces and then go from there.
c) What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization are to make sure private data is kept safe and secured. In addition, that there would be no malware/information theft that can hinder users and the organization.
